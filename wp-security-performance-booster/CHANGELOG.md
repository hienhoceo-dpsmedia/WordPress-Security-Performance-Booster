- Improved textdomain loading honoring the selected locale

## [1.0.7] - 2025-09-08

### Added

- Descriptive settings groups with "what it does" and "when to use" guidance

### Changed
- Conditional HTTP and cron blocking based on selected update channels

## [1.0.6] - 2025-09-08

### Fixed
- Finalize plugin header structure: loader is the sole header; core file contains no plugin headers

### Notes
- This version is functionally identical to 1.0.5 with packaging/header cleanups

## [1.0.5] - 2025-09-08

### Changed
- Major refactor: split plugin into a PHP 5.2‚Äìsafe loader (main file) and a core file under `includes/`. This prevents parse errors on older PHP and ensures clean activation behavior.

### Fixed
- Hardened activation path with try/catch and one-time admin notice
- Guard `$wpdb->check_connection()` and make table checks safer
- Replaced short array syntax in admin-bar notice for older PHP compatibility
- Packaging: prepare minimal WordPress-ready ZIP (exclude CI and dev-only files)

## [1.0.2] - 2025-09-08

### Fixed
- Add compatibility fallback for wp_json_encode() on very old WordPress versions

## [1.0.1] - 2025-09-08

### Fixed
- Register activation/deactivation/uninstall hooks at file scope to ensure reliable activation
- Guard get_plugin_data() usage on front-end to prevent potential fatal error when admin bar renders
- Bump plugin version and stable tag to 1.0.1
